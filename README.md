A Spotify clone using HTML and CSS is a web project designed to replicate the look and feel of the popular music streaming service, Spotify. This clone focuses on the front-end design, utilizing HTML for the structure and CSS for the styling. Key features include a navigation bar with links to Home, Search, and Your Library sections, a responsive layout to accommodate various screen sizes, and a visually appealing interface that includes album artwork, playlists, and playback controls. While this project does not incorporate back-end functionality or music streaming capabilities, it serves as a great practice for front-end development skills and UI/UX design.
